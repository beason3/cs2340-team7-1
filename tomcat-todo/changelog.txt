-Started changelog
-Fixed player limits, can't go to confirmation screen with less than 3 players or more than 6, clicking confirm does nothing.
-"Fixed" assigned number of troops. The idea is to not directly copy Risk, so this may be changed in the future.
-Started Player and Territory classes, still using Todo so as to note break dependancies
-Changed TreepMap of Todo (soon to be Players) to ArrayList
-Added seperateCountries method to TodoServlet; ensures each player is in a different country
-M1 for sure finished
